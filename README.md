# CLG-Lesson-4

Where we play around  
- HTML formatting tags
- Divs and Spans
- Display
- IDs and Classes
- Background styling

Still quite confused about the IDs. Some of the videos demo in the lesson showed example with 2 IDs in a HTML page. I thought we can only have one?


Added in lesson 5 CSS selectors
- Descendent selectors
- Child selectors
- Combining Selectors
- CSS positioning (still alittle confused and don't know if I have apply correctly)
